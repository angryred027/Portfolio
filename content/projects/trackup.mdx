# TrackUp - Your Copilot for the Gym

Are you tired of generic workout plans that don't take your individual needs into account? Introducing **TrackUp**, the innovative training app that revolutionizes the way you exercise.

## Personalized Workouts

With TrackUp, you can say goodbye to one-size-fits-all workout routines. Simply create your custom routines, specifying exercises and sets, and let TrackUp do the rest. Using advanced algorithms, TrackUp auto-customizes weights and repetitions based on your fitness level, ensuring every workout is challenging yet achievable.

## Tech Stack

TrackUp is built using cutting-edge technologies to deliver a smooth and intuitive user experience:

- **Next.js**: Provides server-side rendering and seamless navigation for a fast and responsive app.
- **React**: Powers the interactive user interface, allowing for dynamic updates and smooth interactions.
- **SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate)**: Handles data fetching with built-in caching, ensuring up-to-date information without sacrificing performance.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes utility-first CSS framework for rapid development and easy customization.
- [**Pol-UI**](https://polgubau.com/projects/polui): Enhances the UI with pre-designed components and layouts, speeding up development time and maintaining consistency.

## Collaborative Development

At TrackUp, we believe in the power of collaboration to create exceptional products. While I spearheaded the development of the frontend page, I worked closely with my colleague <At label='Gerard Martinez' href='https://github.com/GerardM5'/> , who is the main maintainer of the backend infrastructure built with **Spring** and **PostgreSQL**.

### Frontend Development

As the lead frontend developer, I took charge of crafting the user interface and experience of TrackUp. Leveraging technologies like Next.js, React, SWR, Tailwind CSS, and Pol-UI, I designed and implemented the frontend page to be intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing. Every element of the frontend page, from the layout to the interactions, was meticulously crafted to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable workout tracking experience.

## Team Collaboration

Our collaboration extends beyond individual contributions to encompass a shared vision for TrackUp. By combining our strengths in frontend and backend development, we have created a holistic fitness app that seamlessly integrates frontend elegance with backend robustness. Together, we are dedicated to continuously improving TrackUp and providing users with the best possible workout tracking experience.
