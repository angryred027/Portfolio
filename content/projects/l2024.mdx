# L2024 Project

## The Story

L2024 is a web project to illustrate a personal challenge of walking over all Metro stations in Barcelona tube network in a year. The project is named after the year 2024, when the challenge was done.

  />
</div>


The challenge started as a personal goal to walk more and discover the city with <At label='Marcos Rayo' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcos-rayo-garc%C3%ADa-308342308/'/>. So we scheduled each last Saturday of the month to walk over a different line of the Metro network but in the street level. The project was born to keep track of the progress and share it with friends and family.

### People involved

The best part of the challenge was the people involved, we shared the activity with multiple friends and they came in different dates, so each metro line has converted into a new and interesant day, not just because the people but because everyone that has been part off the completion.


## The Website 

Personally, the best part of the challenge has been recording our GPS activity while walking and take a photo in each stop, with the goal of creating a website where to share our activity.

The project was built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Typescript**. 

I exported each route in KMP format from different sources as multiple phone apps and Google Maps, then using <a href='https://gpx.studio/'>GPX Studio</a> I edited the incorrect lines, the missing references and the points of interest. Once there I exported the lines in GPX and converted it into GeoJson, a format that makes the map manipulation easier in JavaScript.
The results are geometry points in 3 dimensions and then a line connects all them.
```json
"geometry": {
  "type": "LineString",
  "coordinates": [
    [2.119049, 41.398776, 129.8],
    [2.119456, 41.399061, 131.8],
    [2.119314, 41.399147, 132],
    [2.119277, 41.399126, 132],
    [2.119186, 41.399148, 131.8],
    [2.11927, 41.399069, 131.5],
    [2.119327, 41.399108, 131.8],
```

This Jsons are exported into a typescript file with some metadata of the line used later for UX purposes:
```typescript
export const linesData: LineType[] = [
{
    id: "L1",
    gpx: line1,
    metadata: {
      title: "L1",
      transport: "metro",
      subtitle: "Hospital de Bellvitge / Fondo",
      color: "#df2937",
      distance: 29.64,
      metro_distance: 20.2,
      stations: 30,
      timeWalking: "06:56:45",
      velocity: 3.38,
      dateTime: "2024-02-03T09:44:01.928Z",
      time: "04:42:45",
    },
  },
  {
    id: "L2",
    gpx: line2,
    metadata: {
      title: "L2",
      subtitle: "ParalÂ·lel / Badalona Pompeu Fabra",
      timeWalking: "04:04:00",
      distance: 17.18,
    ...},
  ...}
...]
      ```
