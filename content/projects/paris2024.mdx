# The Paris 2024 Group Thesis

## What is Paris 2024?

Paris 2024 is a project for the course of **Leadership and Management** of the **Linnaeus University**, Sweden. It consists of a multi-frame analysis of the Olympic Games that will take place in Paris in 2024. It's based on the biggest sociologists and political economists such as Max Weber

The project is divided into 4 main parts:

- **Structural Framework as Blue**: The first part of the project is to analyze the structural framework of the Olympic Games. This includes the political, economic, social and cultural aspects of the event. We analyze the Board of directors, the sponsors, the bureaucracy, the media and the spectators.

- **Human Resources as Red**: The second part of the project is to analyze the human resources of the Olympic Games. This includes the athletes, the volunteers, the staff and the spectators. This is where we analyze the human resources of the event as well as the social and cultural aspects.

- **Power Framework Analysis as Yellow**: The third part of the project is to analyze the power framework of the Olympic Games. This includes the Stakeholders, sponsors, City of Paris as well as several soft and hard power aspects.

- **Symbolic Framework as Green**: The fourth part of the project is to analyze the symbolic framework of the Olympic Games. This includes the symbols, the rituals, the ceremonies, the mascots, the torch, the medals and the Olympic flame.

Then we have to analyze the **intersections** between the different frameworks and the **contradictions** that may arise.

### Purpose of the project

## Tech Stack of Paris 2024

The project is made with **Svelte** and **SvelteKit**. It's a static website with some transitions between pages, it's just a single page with the key information. The website is hosted in **Vercel**.

The content is written in **JSON** and the website is generated with **SvelteKit**.

The media and mockups were generated by me with **Figma**.

1. **Svelte** as the modern javascript framework.
2. **SvelteKit** as the static site generator.
3. **Sass** as the CSS preprocessor.
4. **Figma** as the design tool.
5. **Vercel** as the hosting platform.

## My role in Paris 2024

I took part in a 4 people team. We were divided in 4 parts, each one of us had to analyze one of the frameworks. I was in charge of the **Structural Framework**. I had to analyze the political, economic, social and cultural aspects of the event. I also had to analyze the Board of directors, the sponsors, the bureaucracy, the media and the spectators.

I was also in charge of the complete **design and development** of the website. I had to design the website and develop it with SvelteKit and sass.

## Conclusion

This project was a great experience to learn about the Olympic Games and the different frameworks that are involved in the event. It was also a great experience to work with SvelteKit and Vercel.
