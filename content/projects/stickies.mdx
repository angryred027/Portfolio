# Stickies

## What is Stickies?

Stickies is a web application to take notes and manage them. You can make private notes and classify them into categories.

Has been a side project for some months where I leaned modern web development and was the key to convince me to focus my learning on **Reactive technologies**.

## Tech Stack

Stickies it's based in modern web development technologies as:

- **React** as the main framework for javascript development, it allows to create reusable components and manage the state of the application.

- **Redux** as the state manager, it allows to manage the state of the application in a global way and to be able to access it from any component.

- **Typescript** as the main language, it allows to have a typed code and to be able to detect errors in the code before executing it.

- **Styled Components** as the main CSS framework, it allows to create components with their own styles and to be able to reuse them in the application.

- **React Icons** as the main icon library, it allows to use icons in the application in a simple way.

## My role in Stickies

I have been the only developer of the project, I have been in charge of the design and development of the application.

So far I have developed the following features:

- **Idea and concept** of the application.

- **Design** of the service architecture.

- **Prototyping** of the application in design tools.

- **Development** of the application in React.

- **Deployment** of the application in Vercel.

## What I learned

Stickies has been the mind changing project that has allowed me to aim to be a **Frontend Developer**. I have learned a lot about modern web development and I have been able to apply it in a real project.

I have learned to use **React** as a framework for web development, to manage the state of the application with **Redux**, to use **Typescript** as a programming language, to use **Styled Components** as a CSS framework and to use **React Icons** as an icon library.

## What's next

During 2023, I developed a modern version of Stickies using **Nextjs** and **Tailwind CSS**.
