# Stickies

## What is Stickies?

Stickies is a web application to take notes and manage them. You can make private notes and classify them into categories.

Has been a side project for some months where I leaned modern web development and was the key to convince me to focus my learning on **Reactive technologies**.

## Tech Stack

Stickies it's based in modern web development technologies as:

- **React** as the main framework for javascript development, it allows to create reusable components and manage the state of the application.

- **Redux** as the state manager, it allows to manage the state of the application in a global way and to be able to access it from any component.

- **Typescript** as the main language, it allows to have a typed code and to be able to detect errors in the code before executing it.

- **Styled Components** as the main CSS framework, it allows to create components with their own styles and to be able to reuse them in the application.

- **React Icons** as the main icon library, it allows to use icons in the application in a simple way.

## My role in Stickies

I have been the only developer of the project, I have been in charge of the design and development of the application.

So far I have developed the following features:

- **Idea and concept** of the application.

- **Design** of the service architecture.

- **Prototyping** of the application in design tools.

- **Development** of the application in React.

- **Deployment** of the application in Vercel.

## What I learned

Stickies has been the mind changing project that has allowed me to aim to be a **Frontend Developer**. I have learned a lot about modern web development and I have been able to apply it in a real project.

I have learned to use **React** as a framework for web development, to manage the state of the application with **Redux**, to use **Typescript** as a programming language, to use **Styled Components** as a CSS framework and to use **React Icons** as an icon library.

## Modernizing the project

During 2023 I decided to turn a bit the project and modernize it. Stickies used local storage to save the notes, but I wanted to use a database to store the notes and be able to access them from any device.

The problem was that the notes where part of the device, not the user. So if you take notes in your computer, you can't access them from your phone, or if you change browsers....

### The solution, Notes

I created a new project called **Notes** that is the evolution of Stickies. It's a web application to take notes and manage them.

The main difference is that Notes is a **PWA** (Progressive Web App) and it's based in **React** and **NextJS**. It uses **Supabase** as the database and **Vercel** as the hosting service.

It's a **serverless** application, so it's very easy to maintain and scale.

### Tech Stack

Notes it's based in modern web development technologies as:

- **NextJS** as the framework for server side rendering, it allows to create a serverless application and to be able to access it from any device. It's based in React so it's easy to migrate from Stickies.

- **Supabase** as the database, it allows to store the notes in a database and get them each time the user access the application. It's based in **PostgreSQL**.

- **Typescript** as the main language, it allows to have a typed code and to be able to detect errors in the code before executing it.

- **Tailwind CSS** as the main CSS framework, it allows to create components with their own styles and to be able to reuse them in the application.
