# Who am I?

## Origins

I started my career as graphic designer aimed by my <strong>Arts Bachelor</strong> degree where I worked for a few assignments during my high
school even some for the school itself. I also won a few design hackathons:

  These are a few examples of design hackathons submitions that I won during
  2019 and 2020.

As a graphic designer, I was always interested in the digital world and websites in particular. I started to learn
**HTML** and **CSS** by myself, and then I decided to study a technical degree in **Interactive Communication**, in UAB (Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona).

## Interactive Communication

During my degree, I learned a lot about **web development**, **design**, **communication**... I also learned about **video editing** and **photography** with some opportunities to work in a few projects for real clients.

The first year of the degree I faced some technologies that I already knew as Python or PHP, I remember that I was the only one in the class that knew how to code in Python so I helped a bit the rest of the class, reaching the point that the teacher used my notes to correct the homeworkü§ì (it's searchable online).

I also learne about **Photography** and **Communication Law**, subjects that the first day I thought I would hate but I ended up loving and still using them in my day-to-day.

### First steps in the labor market

The Photography teacher encouraged us to search real projects using the class
knowledge, so with <At href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerard-martinez-alcocer/" label="Gerard" /> and <At href="https://www.instagram.com/victorciezar" label="Victor" />
we started checking google maps to find
companies that could need a photographer and we started to call them. We ended
up working for a few car dealerships as photographers and video editors.

Thinking about expanding the small business that we had, I decided to create a website for having an online presence so I did a simple but fancy **landing page** with our portfolio, a contact form and a **blog** where we could post our latest projects. Some people started contacting but not for the photography services, they wanted a website like the one that I did for us.

## Freelance web developer

I was the only one in the friends group that knew how to code so I started to submit proposals to the clients that contacted us.The average project was an easy wordpress landing and ecomerce website, so I learned **Wordpress** and **Woocommerce** to be able to do them. I also learned **SEO** and **Google Ads** to be able to offer a complete service to the clients.

### Wordpress developer

The second year of the degree we did some PHP courses, I had some advantage because I already knew the language so I focused in checking a step further as **MVC** and **OOP**. I also learned **MySQL** and how to use them with PHP. And finally, I faced **Laravel** but was definitely too much for me at that moment.

### SEO and Google Ads

A bit frustrated because I couldn't do the projects that I wanted with PHP, I started to learn **Javascript** and **Jquery** by myself and I started to do some projects with them. I also learned **Bootstrap** and **SASS** to be able to do better websites.

### Javascript developer

Using PHP, HTML, SASS ans Jquery (a bit outdated but still the standard that year) I completed a fancy portfolio, class projects and small client projects.

## Graphic designer

Once in my German language class, I met a guy that was working in a startup that needed a graphic designer, so I started to work for them. During the following 2 years, I worked there creating social media posts and general branding inside of the communication department. I also mastered **Illustrator** and **Photoshop** to be able to do better designs but after some tests we decided to use **Figma** as the main design tool.

  <BlogLink slug="/projects/nuwe" name="Check what I did in Nuwe" />
</div>
As they were a small team, I had some free time while submitions, so I also focused
in development to be able to be hired as a Software developer soon.

## Fullstack developer

The third year of the degree we started modern frontend as **Javascript** and **Databases**, but the courses done in class were too basic for me so I started to learn **React** and **Node** by myself. I also learned **PostgreSQL** and **Typescript** to be able to do fullstack projects.

React and Typescript were a game changer for me, I started to do more complex projects and I started to learn **NextJS** and **Gatsby** to be able to do **SSR** and **Static** websites. I also learned **Tailwind** and **Styled Components** to be able to do better websites.

Using some personal project and small client projects I completed a fancy portfolio (previous to this one you are navigating on). Also, I worked as a fullstack developer inside of the university for a few months.
There, I learned **AWS** and **WebTV** to be able to do a complete project where we had to do a **Netflix** like platform for the internal university projects.

# Mesalvo

During those months, I found myself using my free time to create small frontend side projects, that reveled me that I was more interested in Frontend than just design.

While I was creating content for Nuwe, I decided to search a job as a Frontend Sofware Developer and I found one at **Mesalvo**, was a huge step for me because it was a full time job and I was still studying. In the last moment, I decided to accept the offer and I started to work there.

## Full time Frontend developer

That huge step resulted in one of my best decision ever, I met incredible people and I mastered my skills as a Frontend developer. We created international products using **React**, **Typescript**, **Redux**, **Tailinwd**...

My division was a small team inside of the Innovation HUB of the company, so we had a lot of freedom to create new projects and to decide the technologies that we wanted to use. With <At label='Francesco' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-fabrissin/'/> and <At label='Emiliano' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/emiliano-de-santis-64619040/'/> we created an incredible ecosystem and it resulted in a high quality product.

## Erasmus in Sweden

The second semester of the third year I did an Erasmus to **Kalmar, Sweden** where I focused my skills also in **International Business** and **Marketing**. I also learned a bit **Swedish** to be able to communicate with the locals.

## Back to Spain

Once back in Spain, I focused even more in Mesalvo and I started playing with **React Native** to be able to do mobile apps. Also I did some projects using **Astro** and **Svelte** to be able to do **Static** websites and to discover these 'posible new Reacts'.

### Thesis - Pol/UI

The last year of the degree I had to do a thesis, so I decided create something useful for my future, I created high customizable and extendable **UI** library for **React**.
It uses **Tailwind** as the main design system and **Typescript** to be able to do a complete library.

<BlogLink slug="/projects/polui" name="Check the Pol/UI Thesis" />

## Studing in Salamanca

The first semester of the last year I did an Erasmus to **Salamanca, Spain** where I focused my skills also in Media and Advertising.

More a theoretical semester than a practical one, I had the oportunity to learn from high level teachers and to meet incredible people.

Using my **Big Data and Knowledge Society** I continued my **Python skills** to practice with **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**.

I also took part in a **European Union** project to support some European activities and social projects.

For some submittions I had written some **articles** and **essays** about **Spanish Media** and **Advertising**.

# Today

And that's it, I'm still working proudly at Mesalvo and I'm still learning new things every day.
I'm also working on some side projects and I'm always open to new opportunities.
