## Introduction:

Pol-ui is a set of tools for React that allow you to spend your time on what really matters, your application.


Born from a need for simplicity in the ever-expanding realm of web development, Pol-UI was initiated on July 8, 2023. This is not just another library of React components; it's a focused solution, a set of building blocks created to make your life easier when working with React.

Pol-UI aims to be the straightforward answer to the overwhelming array of choices in the modern tech stack. Developed as part of my University Thesis project, this library comprises reusable React components.
