Next.js is a powerful **React-based framework** that makes it easy to build fast and scalable web applications. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key features of Next.js and how they can be used to build rich and dynamic web applications. This blog post is targeted towards technical readers who want to get up to speed on Next.js quickly, so we will include plenty of coding examples and practical information.

# Key Features of Next.js

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Next.js provides a unique approach to server-side rendering (SSR) that makes it easy to implement on any project. With Next.js, SSR is enabled by default, meaning that all pages are server-rendered unless explicitly marked as client-rendered.

When a page is requested by a client, Next.js will **fetch the required data and generate an HTML page on the server**. This allows for the page to be fully rendered and returned to the client, improving the initial load time and overall performance of the application.

One of the key benefits of SSR is improved search engine optimization (SEO), as search engines can easily crawl and index the content of the page. Additionally, SSR provides better accessibility and support for non-JavaScript clients.

\`\`\`jsx
import React from 'react';
import { getServerSideProps } from 'next';

function Home({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  };
}

export default Home;
\`\`\`

In this example, we are using **\`getServerSideProps\`** to fetch data from an API and pass it to the **\`Home\`** component as props. When the page is requested, Next.js will fetch the data and render the component on the server before sending it to the client.




## **Automatic Code Splitting**

Next.js includes a powerful feature called automatic code splitting, which allows you to split your application code into smaller chunks. This means that only the code that is required for a particular page is loaded, reducing the initial load time of the application and improving performance.

By default, Next.js will automatically split code based on page routes, meaning that each page will only load the code it needs. This makes it easy to build large-scale applications that can be loaded quickly and efficiently.

## **Static Site Generation (SSG)**

Next.js provides support for static site generation (SSG), allowing you to pre-render pages at build time and serve them as static files. This can result in even faster load times for the end user, as the page content is served directly from the server.

With SSG, Next.js will generate static HTML pages for each page in your application at build time, based on the data available at that time. This approach can be particularly useful for applications with largely static content, such as blogs or landing pages.



\`\`\`jsx
import React from 'react';
import { getStaticProps } from 'next';

function Home({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  };
}

export default Home;
\`\`\`


In this example, we are using **getStaticProps** to fetch data from an API and pass it to the **Home** component as props. Next.js will generate a static HTML page at build time that includes the fetched data. When the page is requested, the pre-generated HTML is sent to the client, resulting in faster page loads and improved performance.



## **API Routes**

Next.js includes a built-in API routing system, which allows you to easily create API endpoints for your application. With API routes, you can define serverless functions that can be used to fetch data, manipulate data, or perform other backend operations.

API routes can be used to create both RESTful and GraphQL APIs, making it easy to build flexible and scalable server-side functionality. Additionally, API routes can be used to connect to external APIs, allowing you to build complex applications that can interact with a variety of services.


\`\`\`jsx
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, world!' });
}
\`\`\`
In this example, we are creating an API endpoint at **/api/hello** that returns a JSON response with a simple greeting message. The **handler** function receives a **req** (request) and **res** (response) object that can be used to handle incoming requests and send responses.

## **Next.js Plugins**

Next.js includes a powerful plugin system, which allows you to extend the functionality of the framework with ease. There are many plugins available that can help with tasks such as performance optimization, image optimization, and more.

Plugins can be installed using npm or yarn, and can be easily integrated into your application with minimal configuration. This makes it easy to add additional functionality to your Next.js application without having to write complex code.
