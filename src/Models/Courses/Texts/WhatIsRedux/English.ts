# **Redux**

Redux is a **popular JavaScript library** for managing application state. It was developed by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark and is widely used by developers around the world. Redux is an open-source project and has a large community of contributors.

## **What is state?**

In React, state is a JavaScript object that contains data relevant to a component. For example, a component that renders a list of items might have an array of items in its state. The component can then render the list of items using the array in state.

## **What is Redux?**

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It is often used with React, but can also be used with other view libraries such as Angular and Vue. Redux can be used with a variety of build tools, including Webpack and Parcel.

## **Why use Redux?**

There are many reasons why you might want to use Redux in your application. Here are some of the most common reasons:

- **Predictable state management:** Redux makes it easy to reason about how changes to state affect your application.
- **Centralized state management:** Redux makes it easy to manage the state of your entire application in a single location.
- **Large community:** Redux has a large community of contributors and users, and is widely used by developers around the world.

## **Redux fundamentals**

Redux is built around the idea of a **store**. The store is an object that holds the application's state. The store is created using the **createStore** function, which is provided by Redux.

Here is an example of how to create a store using the **createStore** function:

\`\`\`js
import { createStore } from 'redux';

const store = createStore();
\`\`\`

The store has three important methods:

- **getState:** Returns the current state of the application.
- **dispatch:** Allows you to dispatch actions to change the state of the application.
- **subscribe:** Allows you to register a callback function that will be called any time the state of the application changes.

Here is an example of how to use the **getState** method:

\`\`\`js
const state = store.getState();
\`\`\`

Here is an example of how to use the **dispatch** method:

\`\`\`js
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
\`\`\`

Here is an example of how to use the **subscribe** method:

\`\`\`js
store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log('The state has changed.');
});
\`\`\`

## **Reducers**

The store holds the application's state, but how is the state actually updated? This is where **reducers** come in.

A reducer is a function that is responsible for updating the state of the application. Whenever you call **store.dispatch** to dispatch an action, the store will call the reducer function and pass two arguments to it:

- **The current state of the application.** This is the first argument that is passed to the reducer function.
- **The action that was dispatched.** This is the second argument that is passed to the reducer function.

The reducer function is responsible for returning the new state of the application. Here is an example of a reducer function:

\`\`\`js
function reducer(state, action) {
  // Calculate and return the new state of the application
}
\`\`\`

You can pass the reducer function to the **createStore** function to create the store:

\`\`\`js
import { createStore } from 'redux';

const store = createStore(reducer);
\`\`\`

## **Actions**

In Redux, **actions** are plain JavaScript objects that represent an intention to change the state of the application. Actions are created using action creators, which are simply functions that return actions. Here is an example of an action creator:

\`\`\`js
function incrementActionCreator() {
  return {
    type: 'INCREMENT'
  };
}
\`\`\`

You can dispatch actions to change the state of the application using the **store.dispatch** method:

\`\`\`js
store.dispatch(incrementActionCreator());
\`\`\`

## **Action types**

Actions are plain JavaScript objects, so they can be created using object literals. However, it's a good idea to define string constants for your action types. This helps to avoid typos and makes it easier to share action types between different modules. Here is an example of how to define action types using string constants:

\`\`\`js
const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';
\`\`\`

Here is an example of how to use the action types in an action creator:

\`\`\`js
function incrementActionCreator() {
  return {
    type: INCREMENT
  };
}
\`\`\`

## **Action creators**

In Redux, **action creators** are functions that return actions. Action creators are typically defined using the **actionCreator** helper function provided by Redux. Here is an example of how to define an action creator using the **actionCreator** helper function:

\`\`\`js
import { actionCreator } from 'redux';

const incrementActionCreator = actionCreator(INCREMENT);
\`\`\`

Here is an example of how to use the action creator:

\`\`\`js
store.dispatch(incrementActionCreator());
\`\`\`

## **Reducers**

In Redux, **reducers** are functions that are responsible for updating the state of the application. Reducers are typically defined using the **reducer** helper function provided by Redux. Here is an example of how to define a reducer using the **reducer** helper function:

\`\`\`js
import { reducer } from 'redux';

const counterReducer = reducer(0, {
  [INCREMENT]: (state, action) => state + 1,
  [DECREMENT]: (state, action) => state - 1
});
\`\`\`

Here is an example of how to use the reducer function:

\`\`\`js
const state = counterReducer(0, incrementActionCreator());
\`\`\`

## **Redux middleware**

In Redux, **middleware** is code that sits between the store and the reducers. Middleware can be used to intercept dispatched actions, perform some logic, and then dispatch new actions.

Redux comes with several built-in middleware functions:

- **applyMiddleware:** Allows you to apply multiple middleware functions to the store.
- **bindActionCreators:** Allows you to bind multiple action creators to the store's **dispatch** method.
- **combineReducers:** Allows you to combine multiple reducers into a single reducer function.
- **compose:** Allows you to compose multiple functions into a single function.

Here is an example of how to use the **applyMiddleware** middleware function:

\`\`\`js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';

const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(middleware1, middleware2));
\`\`\`

Here is an example of how to use the **bindActionCreators** middleware function:

\`\`\`js
import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux';

const boundActionCreators = bindActionCreators(actionCreators, store.dispatch);
\`\`\`

Here is an example of how to use the **combineReducers** middleware function:

\`\`\`js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  counter: counterReducer,
  todos: todosReducer
});
\`\`\`

Here is an example of how to use the **compose** middleware function:

\`\`\`js
import { compose } from 'redux';

const composedFunction = compose(func1, func2, func3);
\`\`\`

## **Redux DevTools**

Redux DevTools is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that provides tools for debugging Redux applications. It allows you to inspect the state of your application at any point in time, view a history of dispatched actions, and even "time travel" to any previous state of the application.

Here is an example of how to use Redux DevTools:

\`\`\`js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';

const store = createStore(reducer, composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(middleware)));
\`\`\`

## **Redux Thunk**

Redux Thunk is a middleware function for Redux that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods **dispatch** and **getState** as parameters.

Here is an example of how to use Redux Thunk:

\`\`\`js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
\`\`\`

Here is an example of how to write an action creator that returns a function:

\`\`\`js
function incrementAsync() {
  return (dispatch, getState) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      dispatch(incrementActionCreator());
    }, 1000);
  };
}
\`\`\`
