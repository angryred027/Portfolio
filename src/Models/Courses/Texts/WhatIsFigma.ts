# **Features of Figma**

## **Vector Editing**

One of the key features of Figma is its vector editing capabilities. Users can create and edit vectors directly in Figma, making it a great tool for creating logos, icons, and other graphical elements. The vector editor in Figma is powerful and easy to use, allowing users to create complex designs with ease.

## **Real-time Collaboration**

Figma is an online-based design tool, which means that it can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. This also means that users can collaborate in real-time on the same design. This is especially useful for teams that are working remotely, as it allows them to work together as if they were in the same room.

## **Component Libraries**

Figma allows users to create and share component libraries, which are collections of reusable design elements. This makes it easy to maintain consistency across designs and reduces the amount of time needed to create new designs. Components can be updated in real-time, making it easy to make changes across all designs that use the component.

### **Creating Components**
Components can be created in Figma by selecting a group of elements and clicking the "Create Component" button. Once a component is created, it can be added to a component library and shared with other users.

### **Using Components**
Components can be used in Figma by dragging them from the component library into the canvas. Once a component is added to the canvas, it can be edited just like any other element.

### **Updating Components**
Components can be updated in Figma by editing the original component in the component library. Once a component is updated, it will be updated across all designs that use the component.

## **Design Systems**

Figma allows users to create and share design systems, which are collections of reusable design elements. This makes it easy to maintain consistency across designs and reduces the amount of time needed to create new designs. Design systems can be updated in real-time, making it easy to make changes across all designs that use the design system.

### **Creating Design Systems**
Design systems can be created in Figma by selecting a group of elements and clicking the "Create Design System" button. Once a design system is created, it can be added to a design system library and shared with other users.

### **Using Design Systems**
Design systems can be used in Figma by dragging them from the design system library into the canvas. Once a design system is added to the canvas, it can be edited just like any other element.

### **Updating Design Systems**
Design systems can be updated in Figma by editing the original design system in the design system library. Once a design system is updated, it will be updated across all designs that use the design system.


## **Prototyping**

Figma allows users to create interactive prototypes that can be shared with stakeholders for feedback. This is useful for designers who want to test their designs before they are implemented. The prototyping capabilities in Figma are easy to use and allow designers to create interactive designs quickly.
